# Meta Two-Sample Testing

Hi, this is the core code of our rencent work "Meta Two-Sample Testing: Learning Kernels for Testing with Limited Data" (NeurIPS2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07636). This work is done by 

- Dr. Feng Liu (UTS), feng.liu@uts.edu.au
- Dr. Wenkai Xu (Gatsby Unit, UCL), wenkaix@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk
- Prof. Jie Lu (UTS), jie.lu@uts.edu.au
- Dr. Danica J. Sutherland (UBC), djs@djsutherland.ml.


# Software version
Torch version is 1.1.0. Python version is 3.8.5. CUDA version is 10.1.

For the implementation of most baselines, please refer to https://github.com/fengliu90/DK-for-TST.

These python files, of cause, require some basic scientific computing python packages, e.g., numpy. I recommend users to install python via Anaconda (python 3.8.5), which can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section . If you have installed Anaconda, then you do not need to worry about these basic packages.

After you install anaconda and pytorch (gpu), you can run codes successfully.

# Meta kernel learning

Please feel free to test the Meta-KL testing method by running main_metaKL.py.

Specifically, please run

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_metaKL.py
```

in your terminal (using the first GPU device).

It can be seen that, test power on the target task will be significantly improved after introducing related tasks.
